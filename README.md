## Becoming A Pro
So you've made it through the QuickShare Portal Installer? Good stuff. Now, let's start using QuickShare!

## Navigating Repos and Viewing Folder Data

QuickShare has three data 'levels':
1. **The File Repository Dropdown**
   * At this level, all database slots are contained for various types of files (Excel Macros, Documentation, installers, etc).
2. **File Folders**
   * At this level, files within the database are seperated into categories (Excel Macros, Documentation, installers, etc).
3. **The Sync Table**
    * The Sync Table contains multiple rows and columns (File Name, File Size, File Added, File Actions) and houses folder files.

This sounds like a mouthful, but it's really quite simple. The dropdown contains databases for files, the <br>databases contain folders, and within each folder are files that are displayed in the Sync Table.

## Navigating to QuickShare Folders
<p>When you enter a repository you will be prompted to enter a folder name to continue. Each folder contains a unique group of files that are all related but performed different tasks. If you don't know what folder your data is from, just leave the prompt blank and hit 'enter' or click 'Ok'. Then, navigate to 'Data Options ---> Edit File Info' and you should see a section called 'Data Folders'. Click on one of the folders to go back to the folder prompt window, and enter the name of the folder you'd like to traverse. Once you do that, your data should successfully populate into the table! If it doesn't however, check your spelling to make sure you entered the right name.</p>

## Uploading Files
<p>GTM QuickShare automates most of this process for you. All you need to do is navigate to 'Data Options' and select 'browse' then click on the file you want to upload (Currently files MUST be zipped) then wait for it to process. Once complete, hit the 'Upload File' button. You've successfully uploaded the file! You will also have the option to name your files, but remember that this process is automated and a name is chosen for you by default.</p>

## Downloading Files
<p>This one is super simple. Once you're inside the folder you want to get files from, click on name of the file under the 'File Name' row and it will start downloading.</p>

## Deleting Files
<p>Under the 'File Actions' row, click on the trashcan and the file in that row will be removed.</p>

Congrats, you're officially a pro! Now go out there and connect your team with an easy yet powerful file sharing repository!
