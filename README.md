## Getting Started
### Navigating to GTM QuickShare.
The first and most obvious step in understanding GTM QuickShare is actually using it.

1. Click <a href="https://iamshawn98.github.io/gtm-quickshare/index.html">HERE</a> to open GTM QuickShare.
   * GTM QuickShare only supports modern web browsers such as: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge">Microsoft Edge</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>, or <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>.
   So if QuickShare opens in Internet Explorer, copy the link, and re-open it in one of the recommended
   browsers, otherwise it will not work.

### Explaining the QuickShare Portal
This step isn't essential to use QuickShare, but is highly recommended.
<br> <br>
The 'QuickShare Portal' is a convenient browser Extension that allows you to access:
1. GTM QuickShare without typing it in your address bar.
2. Download QuickShare in the event of a server outage.
3. Access our Github anytime to read recent change logs, commits, etc.

### Installing the QuickShare Portal
1. Using the same link you used to before, navigate to GTM QuickShare and scroll to the bottom of the home page.

## Understanding File Repositories
QuickShare File repositories are like big boxes containing file folders.

1. Open GTM QuickShare (Preferably by using the QuickShare Portal).
2. In the upper left corner of the page, click on the 'File Repositories' dropdown button.
3. Click on any of the available file repositories (right now there is only one).
4. At this point, you should be sent to the file repository you clicked on
   and instructions will appear on how to navigate and create folders.

Please Note: *These instructions are also listed below.*

### Navigating to Folders
1. Type the name of the folder you want to view in the box below. If you don't know which folder you want, leave it blank and do #2.
2. Navigate to 'Data Options ---> Data Folders' to view a list of all available folders.
3. Click on one of the folders to bring you back here or do the shortcut 'CTRL + R'.
4. Then enter the name of the folder into the box below. The Sync Table should then populate with your folder data.

### Creating New Folders
1. Enter a new folder name into the box below, ensure the name you picked isn't already an existing folder.
2. Upload at least one file and the folder should appear in the 'Data Folders' tab in 'Data Options'.
3. That's It! Your new Folder containing your new file should now be under 'Data Options'.

### Understanding Sync Tables
Think of Sync Tables as a place that you spread out your folder data to view and manipulate files.
Once you enter a folder name, the Sync Table shows you results from data within that specified folder.
Then you can perform actions such as uploading, downloading, and deleting files.

## Becoming A 'Pro'
1. You've Installed the 'QuickShare Portal'.
2. You've Learned About 'File Repositories'.
3. Now It's Time to Become A "Pro"!

### File Search
You may have noticed the 'File Search' field under the 'Data Options' button in the Sync Table.
If you haven't, there it is! You can use it to filter results from your data. This is handy if
there are more than 10 files in a table, allowing you to get right to the files you need to do
whatever it is your doing with them. Try it! Look for a file in the table and search for it.
You will notice the table will remove files that don't match your search criteria but will
show multiple files if they share farmiliar characteristics.

*This is a demo of file searching.*

### Downloading Files
The one is pretty simple - In the Sync Table under 'File Name' click on any of file names to receive them.

### Uploading Files
'Casucal' (TIME CONSUMING) Upload Approach
1. Make sure the file you're uploading is zipped before trying to upload them, otherwise your file will not upload.
2. Navigate to 'Data Options' and click on 'browse' and select the file you want to upload.
3. Depending on how long it takes to upload, you may see a progress bar letting you know how long your file has left to upload.
4. Each of the form fields will auto-fill so you don't need to enter any data (But you can if you want to pick file names).
5. When the file is ready and the 'Upload File' button is availbile to click, click on it.
6. That's it, your file is now inside the folder you entered and will be present when you refresh the page.

WOW.... SIX ENTIRE STEPS?! I know, but HAVE NO FEAR.... The casual approach is long, but QuickShare PROS know the shortcuts:

'PRO' (TIME SAVING) Upload Approach
1. Browse File: Shift + D + U.
2. Push File: Shift + P.

That's it! The entire process has been automated and reduced from SIX STEPS to only TWO steps!

Also, if you want to save a few keystrokes instead of doing Shift + D + U, just do Shift + U.
Doing this will not only save a keystroke, but you won't even have to look at the form to
upload files. Just listen for a sound before pushing files. You will hear a sound when the
file has finished uploading, then do Shift + P to PUSH your file to the Sync Table.

Congrats, you're now a QuickShare PRO!
